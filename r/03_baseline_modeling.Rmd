The goal of this phase is to establish a baseline predictive model using *enrollment-time* patient characteristics only. This model serves as a reference point for evaluating the predictive value of treatment assignment in later analyses.

### Modeling Question

Can we predict which patients will respond (as dictated by outcomes$responder_30pct) using the attributes available at the beginning of the trial? These attributes include:

### Planned Attribute Sets 

#### Baseline-Only Attributes (Model 1)

sex, age, bmi, smoker, comorbidity_count, baseline_severity, crp_mgL, alt_U_L, egfr_ml_min
self_reported_adherence

#### Baseline + Treatment (Model 2)

All baseline_only attributes + treatment_arm


#### Consider Later:

site_id, enroll_date
